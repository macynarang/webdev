    <h2>Summary</h2>
    (I drew this.) <br/>
    NOTE: I don't have an actual resume, and I don't think I have much I could even put on one. To make this assignment easier for myself, I will approach the concept of a resume with slight irreverence at points. However, I do respect the intentions of this assignment.
