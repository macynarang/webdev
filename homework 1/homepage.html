    <h2>summary</h2>
    this is a picture i drew. ^ <br/>
    note: i don't have an actual resume, and i don't think i have much i could even put on one. thus, i will approach the resume concept with irreverent humor to make it easier to complete. however, i respect the intentions of this assignment.
